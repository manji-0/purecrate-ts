# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-30

Iteration, the largest gap the examples measured against idiomatic Rust ([roadmap §8](https://github.com/manji-0/purecrate-ts/blob/main/design/07-roadmap.md#8-releases)).

### Added

- `for x in &xs`, `xs.iter()`, `xs.into_iter()`, and `for x in xs` over a `Vec` or slice, and `for b in s.bytes()`; printed as `for..of`. Iterator adaptors (`enumerate`, `rev`, `zip`, …) are refused with a message.
- `for t in s.split(c)` with a `char` separator: each `&str` piece, empty ones included, as JS `split` gives them. A `&str` separator is refused (an empty one splits differently in Rust and JS).
- `while`, `break`, and `continue`, without labels or values. A loop that a jump leaves is labelled in the output, since a bare JS `break` inside the `switch` a `match` prints as would leave the `switch`. A `?` in a `while` condition runs before every pass.
- `purecrate-ts --version` and `--help`.

### Changed

- The generated `tsconfig.json` sets `allowUnreachableCode: false`, and a `case` that ends in a jump has no trailing `break;`. Output committed with 0.1.0 and checked with `check --out` must be regenerated.
- `loop`, `while let`, and labelled jumps are still refused, now with messages that say what to write.

### Examples

- oidc reads bytes, lists, and candidates with the new loops: its lexical helpers went from 99 to 68 lines (from 3.2× to 2.2× the idiomatic code), the file from 810 to 777.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-30

First release. purecrate-ts translates pure domain functions written in a subset of Rust into an ordinary TypeScript package, without WASM, and rejects what it cannot translate with the same meaning. The subset is described in [design/02-authoring](https://github.com/manji-0/purecrate-ts/blob/main/design/02-authoring.md); the equivalence it keeps, in [design/01-equivalence](https://github.com/manji-0/purecrate-ts/blob/main/design/01-equivalence.md).

### What it translates

- Structs, enums (as `kind` unions), newtypes (as brands), `Option`, `Result`, `?`, early `return`, `if let`, and exhaustive `match`: arms naming a variant, `A | B` binding nothing, a last `_`, literal and range patterns on integers, `char`, and `&str`, and `match (state, event)` on tuples.
- Integers with Rust's debug-build semantics: overflow, division by zero, and out-of-range shifts throw with Rust's panic message; `i64`/`u64` are `bigint`; bitwise operators and shifts; widening with `T::from(x)`; `f32`/`f64`.
- `const` items (folded at check time into `consts.ts`) and enum discriminants, read with `e as T` when `T` holds every discriminant.
- Strings as UTF-8 byte units (`len`, `starts_with`, `as_bytes`, …), `char` as a branded code point, `for c in s.chars()`, `uuid::Uuid` as the `uuid` crate parses it.
- `Vec` read by index and `len`, and built as a fixed list with `vec![a, b]`; growing sequences as recursive enums.
- Local `let mut`, closures over immutable bindings, struct update, `for i in a..b`, modules (flattened).
- Closed types: structs with private fields are built only through their constructors, in TS as in Rust.
- serde: the same types derive `Serialize`/`Deserialize` for the server; `--schema zod|valibot|arktype` reads serde's JSON into domain values, and `toJson` writes the bytes serde_json writes.

### Commands

- `build` writes an npm package (the runtime copied in, `"private": true` unless `--publishable`).
- `check` rejects out-of-subset input with `path:line:col` and a reason code (most messages also say what to write instead), then runs rustc; with `--out`, it fails when a committed output differs from what `build` would write.
- `survey` estimates how much of an existing crate falls inside the subset.

### Output

- Plain `Readonly` values and arrow functions; passes `tsc --strict` with `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `erasableSyntaxOnly`, and `verbatimModuleSyntax` on TypeScript 6 and 7, and runs under Node's type stripping.
- Checked by differential tests: every example and fixture runs the same inputs through Rust and the generated TS and compares the results, panics included.

### Known limitations

- `check` and `build` run the input through `rustc`, which must be installed. The differential tests were measured on rustc 1.98.1.
- Release binaries are built for Linux (x86_64, aarch64) and macOS (x86_64, arm64). Windows is not built or tested.
- `usize` is a `number` checked to 2^53−1; past that the TS throws where Rust would not.
- No `while`/`loop`, iterator adaptors, growable `Vec`, `HashMap`, generics, or traits (other than `TryFrom` for serde and the skipped `Display`/`Error`). See [design/07-roadmap](https://github.com/manji-0/purecrate-ts/blob/main/design/07-roadmap.md) for what is added next and why.
